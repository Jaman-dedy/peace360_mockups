                    <p>Mainstream and social media are constantly flooded with despondent stories of conflict and war
                        around
                        the world. Yet, while it is crucial to report on these tragedies, the stories of local
                        peacemakers
                        and
                        activists are often left untold. The stories of ordinary citizens, who brave all odds in search
                        of
                        building peaceful communities, often never reach the newsrooms of influential media agencies.
                    </p>

                    <p>Peacemaker 360 is a non-profit working to disrupt this negative pattern by telling the stories of
                        resilience and courage of ordinary people working for peace in their communities and around the
                        world.
                        By so doing, we hope to inspire, connect, amplify activism for peace and justice around the
                        world.</p>

                    <p>We believe that these stories matter to restore the dignity of people in places affected by
                        conflicts
                        and shape transformative peace narratives. We are a 501 c(3) and receive tax-deductible
                        donations in
                        support for our work. Thank you for considering giving any amount to help us reach more peace
                        activists
                        and share their stories of resilience. Thank you.</p>
